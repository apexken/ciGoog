# ciGoog

A pure ClojureScript/HTML web development environment with Cells Inside(tm), specifically [Rube](https://github.com/kennytilton/rube) for and, for the HTML, Google Closure.

## Step 1: Hello, world!
For Cells-driven UIs, "Hello World" consists of instantiating an object in some preferred HLL space and then magically seeing a corresponding UI element appear, all because sufficient un-magical glue has mirrored the first to the second. In this case, a CLJS map will (without special source tooling) become an HTML5 DOM element, a \<p\> in fact.

\[For a peek at where we are going, checkout [Qxia](https://github.com/kennytilton/qxia) which emits [qooxdoo Mobile](http://www.qooxdoo.org/5.0.1/pages/mobile.html) JS widgets instead of HTML.\]
